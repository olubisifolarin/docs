TMDB uses multiple authentication methods, including API key authentication 
for general access, and user authentication using either session IDs or v4 
authentication(bearer tokens) for managing user-specific actions.
You can request an API key by logging in to your account on TMDB and clicking 
<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api" target="_self">here</a>



**Bearer Token**

The default method to authenticate is with your bearer token. If you head into 
your account page, under the API settings section, you will see a new token 
listed called *API Read Access Token*. This token is expected to be sent along as 
an `Authorization` header. Below is a simple cURL example that showcases this method

```cURL Example
  curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

  ```

Using a Bearer token simplifies the authentication process, as it works seamlessly with 
both the `v3` and `v4` methods. Since both options offer identical access levels, the choice 
between them is entirely up to you.

Guest sessions are a second type of user authentication. They have limited permissions
as they can only rate a movie, TV show and TV episode.

Guest sessions are a special kind of session that give you some of the functionality 
of an account, but not all. For example, some of the things you can do with a guest 
session are; maintain a rated list, a watchlist and a favourite list.

<Note>
    Guest sessions will be automatically deleted if not used within 60 minutes of being created.

Just like a fully authorized user session, guest sessions should be kept private as they tie a 
session within your application to a single token.

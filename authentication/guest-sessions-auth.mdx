##
Guest sessions are a second type of user authentication. They have limited permissions
as they can only rate a movie, TV show and TV episode.

Guest sessions are a special kind of session that give you some of the functionality 
of an account, but not all. For example, some of the things you can do with a guest 
session are; maintain a rated list, a watchlist and a favourite list.

### Creating a Guest Session

```bash
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/guest_session/new?api_key=<<api_key>>
```

A successful response will include a guest_session_id, which you can use to authenticate 
subsequent requests that involve rating movies or TV shows.

```
{
  "success": true,
  "guest_session_id": "your_guest_session_id",
  "expires_at": "2025-02-22 01:13:36 UTC"
}
```

<Note>
    - Guest sessions will be automatically deleted if not used within 24 hours of being created.
    - it's recommended to generate only one guest session per user or device
    - Guest sessions should be kept private as they tie a session within your application to a single token

</Note>

### Using Guest Session to Rate a Movie
Once you have a `guest_session_id`, you can rate a movie.
```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}/rating?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&guest_session_id=YOUR_GUEST_SESSION_ID" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"value": 8.5}'

```
Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status_code": 12,
  "status_message": "The item/record was updated successfully."
}
```

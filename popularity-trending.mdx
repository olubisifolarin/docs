## 

The TMDB API offers endpoints that let you discover whatâ€™s popular and trending among movies and TV shows.
These endpoints aggregate real-time data based on user engagement, ratings, and viewership, helping you 
surface content that resonates with your audience.
Here are some of popular endpoints.

- **Movie Popularity:**  
  The `/movie/popular` endpoint returns a list of movies that are currently popular. The ranking is based
   on factors such as user ratings, vote counts, and overall engagement.

- **TV Show Popularity:**  
  Similarly, the `/tv/popular` endpoint provides a list of TV shows that are trending, based on similar metrics.

These endpoints allow you to easily display popular content on your platform, ensuring your users see
the most engaging and relevant movies and TV shows.

### Trending Endpoint

TMDB also offers a unified trending endpoint that spans multiple media types:

- **Trending:**  
  The `/trending/{media_type}/{time_window}` endpoint returns trending content for a specified media type 
  and time window. You can set:
  - **media_type:** `all`, `movie`, or `tv`
  - **time_window:** `day` or `week`

For example, a GET request to `/trending/movie/day` fetches movies trending over the past day, while `/trending/all/week` returns all media types that are trending over the week.

### Use Cases

- **Dynamic Content Displays:**  
  Populate your application with up-to-date lists of popular and trending movies or TV shows to keep 
  your content fresh and engaging.

- **Content Recommendations:**  
  Combine trending data with user preferences to offer personalized recommendations, enhancing user 
  experience and retention.

### Example Request

Here's a quick example using cURL to fetch trending movies for the day:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/trending/movie/day?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY'

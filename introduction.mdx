The TMDB API provides access to a vast collection of movie, TV, image API and actor data. 
It enables developers to search for films, retrieve detailed information, and integrate
multimedia content into their applications.


The API is RESTful and returns data in JSON format, making it easy to integrate with various 
programming languages and platforms.


The API includes a wide range of endpoints for activities such as searching for movies, 
fetching detailed movie information, retrieving TV show data, and more. The endpoints are 
organized by content type (e.g., movies, TV shows, TV season,lists, people).

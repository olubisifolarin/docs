##
You may have noticed that the a v4 version of our list API exists. While these v3 list methods continue to work, all of the new features you can see on our website are only available if you switch to the v4 lists.

**What are some of the improvements in v4?**

- You can import "unlimited" items in a single request
- You can use mixed type (movie and TV) lists
- You can use private lists
- You can add and use comments per item
- There are more sort options
- They are faster
- Check the v4 documentation for more information.

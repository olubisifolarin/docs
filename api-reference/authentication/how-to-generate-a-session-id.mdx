# To be authenticated, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a new request token

This endpoint is used to generate a request token. It can be used to validate a TMDB user login.

<Note>
  The request token expires after 15 minutes.
</Note>

## 2. Authenticate the request token

Before creating your session, you must authenticate your token.

```url
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/your_request_token
```

## 3. Create a new session id

Call the new session method with the request token that has been approved by the user in step 2. 
This will return a new session_id.
<Warning>
  You should treat this key like a password and keep it secret.

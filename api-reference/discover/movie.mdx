**Advanced Filtering**

If you specify the region parameter, the regional release date will be used instead of the primary 
release date. The date returned will be the first date based on your query (ie. if a `with_release_type` is specified). 
It's important to note the order of the release types that are used. Specifying `2|3` would return the limited 
theatrical release date as opposed to `3|2` which would return the theatrical date.

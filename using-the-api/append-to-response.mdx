##
This parameter in the TMDB API allows you to make multiple requests in a 
single API call by appending additional related data. This improves performance by reducing
the number of separate requests needed to fetch extra details about a movie, TV show, or person.

To use this feature, simply include the `append_to_response` parameter in your request URL and 
specify the additional resources you want to include.

```npm bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?append_to_response=videos,credits' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'

```
You can append multiple sections to a request, including:

| Field               | Description                               |

##
The API typically allows up to 40 requests every 10 seconds per IP address. If your
application exceeds this limit, you'll receive a `429` Too Many Requests error.

Monitor your request rates and optimize your application's API calls to remain within 
these limits. If you anticipate a high volume of requests, consider caching responses 
or batching requests where possible.

<Note>
    These limits are subject to change, so for the most up-to-date information, always 
    refer to the <a href="/api-reference/introduction" target="_self">TMDB API Documentation</a>

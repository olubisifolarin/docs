The TMDB API uses pagination to manage large sets of data efficiently. When making requests to 
endpoints that return multiple results, such as movies, TV shows, or people, the response is 
paginated to ensure optimal performance.

Each paginated response includes:

`page`: The current page number.

`total_pages`: The total number of pages available.

`total_results`: The total number of results available.

`results`: An array containing the data for the requested page.

To navigate through different pages, include the `page` parameter in your request. The default value is 1, 
but you can specify any page number up to the `total_pages` value.

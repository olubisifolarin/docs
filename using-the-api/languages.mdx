The TMDB API supports multiple languages, allowing developers to retrieve localized movie and
TV show data based on user preferences. This is useful for applications that cater to an international 
audience and need translated titles, descriptions, and other metadata.

The API allows you to specify a language using the language parameter in your requests. TMDB follows the
`ISO 639-1` and `ISO 3166-1` language codes, such as:

- en-US → English (United States)
- fr-FR → French (France)
- es-ES → Spanish (Spain)
- ja-JP → Japanese (Japan)
- If no language is specified, the API defaults to English (en-US).

<Note>
Images do not yet support the `language-COUNTRY` notation. This will be improved in the future. Take a 
read through the [image language](/image/language) documentation to learn how to partly get around this limitation.

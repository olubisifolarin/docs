**Image Types**

`poster_path`: The `poster_path` will query the language you specify in your query first and default back to the
 highest rated image of the media's "original language" if it's present. If that image doesn't exist, it simply 
 falls back to the highest rated. It's important to note that even though our language query parameter supports 
 regional lookups, these regional variants are not supported for images at this time. This will be getting added 
 at a later date.

`backdrop_path`: Since 99% of backdrops don't contain a language, the default lookup for a backdrop is to simply query for the highest rated backdrop with no language. If it doesn't exist, then we return the overall highest rated.

`still_path`: Like backdrops, TV episode images don't inherently have languages. We query for the highest rated.

**Default Language**
<Note>
Remember, when you query one of the `/images` methods, your language param will filter images. Since you'll 
usually want to query additional `languages`, you'll want to use the `include_image_language` query parameter. 
Think of this as a means to provide a fallback.

Take a look below where we give an example of requesting the images tagged with English and also those not
tagged with any language.
</Note>

```npm bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550/images?language=en-US&include_image_language=en,null' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'

```

Notice the `include_image_language` parameter. This query `(en,null)` is looking for all images that match English
and those that haven't been set yet (null).

Better yet, you can do query this image method in a single request by using `append_to_response`:

```npm bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550/images?language=en-US&include_image_language=en,null' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'

```

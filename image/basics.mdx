Movies, TV shows, and person objects in TMDB contain references to various file paths for images.
To construct a complete image URL, you need three key components: a `base URL`, a `file size`, and a `file path`.

- The base URL and available file sizes can be retrieved from the [/configuration](/api-reference/configuration/details) API.
- The file path is specific to the media object you’re working with.

For example, if a movie's poster_path is /1E5baAaEse26fej7uHcjOgEE2t2.jpg and you want the w500 size, 
the full image URL would be:

```npm bash
https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/1E5baAaEse26fej7uHcjOgEE2t2.jpg  

```

##
**Company and Network Logos**

Logos are available in SVG and PNG formats. However, all `logo_path` fields return a .png by default 
for backward compatibility.

The `file_type` field in image methods indicates the original format of an uploaded asset.

- SVG images should use the original size (/original/), as they are not resized.
- PNG images can be retrieved in any available size.
- For example, Netflix’s logo (wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.svg) can be accessed using:

```npm bash
https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.svg  
https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.png  
https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.png  


```

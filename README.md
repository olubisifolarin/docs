# The TMDB API Documentation 
[My Project Link](https://biscon.mintlify.app/)

## Introduction
Welcome to the TMDB API documentation—a recreation of The Movie Database (TMDB).

This repository provides comprehensive documentation for integrating the TMDB API, covering authentication, endpoints, request examples, response formats, and best practices. With this API, developers and users can access a vast database of movies, TV shows, and actors to build rich entertainment applications.

## Technologies Used
This documentation is built using Postman, OpenAPI Specification, and Mintlify to ensure a seamless, interactive, and developer-friendly experience.

1. OpenAPI Specification (OAS)
The [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](https://editor-next.swagger.io/) is a standard for describing REST APIs in a structured format. It allows developers to:

- Define API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
- Generate interactive API documentation that enhances usability.
- Improve consistency and maintainability across API integrations.

2. Postman
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an API development tool that allows developers to:

- Test and debug API endpoints with various request parameters and payloads.
- Automate API testing with collections and scripts.
- Generate API documentation and mock servers to simulate API responses.
- Simplify collaboration by sharing API requests and responses with teams.

3. Mintlify
[Mintlify](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login) is a modern documentation framework that provides:

- A clean, user-friendly, and interactive documentation experience.
- Automatic deployment and hosting of documentation.
- Features like code blocks, search functionality, and customizable UI components.
- Integration with OpenAPI to display API references dynamically.

> **Note:** This project is a **recreation** of the TMDB API documentation for educational and demonstration purposes. It is not affiliated with the official TMDB API.

## About the Project
This project is built to replicate and enhance the functionality of TMDB, offering users the ability to:

- Search for movies and TV shows by title, genre, or actor.
- View detailed movie information, including cast, crew, and release dates.
- Add movies to personalized watchlists and favorites.
- Fetch high-quality images and posters from TMDB’s extensive database.
- Provide user-friendly navigation and a clean UI for an engaging experience.
  
## Getting Started

To use the TMDB API, you need an API Key. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Create an account on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Navigate to **Settings > API**.
3. Generate your API key.
4. Use the API key to authenticate your requests.

## Development

### Authentication

TMDB API supports two types of authentication:

#### API Key (Query Parameter)

```bash
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```
#### Bearer Token (Recommended)

Use an authorization header with your bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
## To Run This Documentation Locally

To set up this documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository using this command
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
2. Install Dependencies

   - Make sure you have Node.js installed, then install the Mintlify CLI and project dependencies:
```
npm install -g mintlify
mintlify install
```
3. Run the Documentation Locally and start the local development server with:
```
mintlify dev

```

##
TMDB uses multiple authentication methods, including API key authentication 
for general access, and user authentication using either session IDs or v4 
authentication(bearer tokens) for managing user-specific actions.
You can request an API key by logging in to your account on TMDB and clicking 
[here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

**Bearer Token**

The default method to authenticate is with your access token. If you head into 
your account page, under the API settings section, you will see a new token 
listed called `API Read Access Token`. This token is expected to be sent along as 
an `Authorization` header. Below is a simple cURL example that showcases this method

```cURL Example
  curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/4/list/{list_id}' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

  ```

Usiing a Bearer token simplifies the authentication process, as it works seamlessly with 
both the v3 and v4 methods. Since both options offer identical access levels, the choice 
between them is entirely up to you.

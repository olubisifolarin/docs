##

Many community-contributed wrappers and libraries have been developed to simplify working with the 
TMDB API. These tools abstract away low-level details like authentication, URL formatting, and error 
handling, allowing you to integrate TMDB data into your projects more efficiently.
Here are some of popular wrappers.

- **Python:**  
  - <a href="https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/tmdbv3api" target="_self">tmdbv3api</a> – A Python wrapper that simplifies API calls and data parsing.  
  - <a href="https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple" target="_self">tmdbsimple</a> – Another lightweight Python library for interacting with TMDB.

- **JavaScript/Node.js:**  
  - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/themoviedb" target="_self">themoviedb</a>– A Node.js module that provides an easy interface to the TMDB API.  

### Benefits of Using Wrappers

- **Simplified API Interaction:**  
  Wrappers reduce boilerplate code by handling the setup, request formation, and response parsing for you.

- **Built-in Error Handling:**  
  Many libraries include error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage rate limits and API errors.

- **Community Support & Maintenance:**  
  Popular wrappers are often actively maintained and updated by the community, ensuring compatibility with the latest TMDB API changes.

### Getting Started Example

Here’s a quick example of how to use the Python wrapper `tmdbv3api`:

```python
from tmdbv3api import TMDb, Movie

tmdb = TMDb()
tmdb.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

movie = Movie()
results = movie.search('Inception')
print(results)

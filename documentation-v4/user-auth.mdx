Version 4 of the TMDB API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, which is more secure and versatile than 
the API key system used in v3. This authentication method allows applications to access user-specific 
data with proper user consent.

Follow this steps below for your authentication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Request Token">
    To begin the authentication process, you need to create a request token by making a `POST` request to the TMDB API.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.themoviedb.org/4/auth/request_token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token' \
  -d '{
    "redirect_to": "https://www.themoviedb.org/"
  }'
```

*Response*

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "expires_at": "2025-03-07T10:00:00.000Z",
  "request_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```
<Note>
    - The redirect URL (or callback) is an optional parameter you can include with this request. It will execute
    the request token and grant approval on TMDB.
    - Remember to replace `your_access_token` with your actual API access token.
    - The `request_token` is valid for 60 minutes
</Note>
</Step>
 
<Step title="Asking for approval on TMDB">
    Next, In order for a user to approve the request token, they have to be redirected to the website.
```
https://www.themoviedb.org/auth/access?request_token={request_token}
```
<Note>
  Ensure you replace `request_token` with the token received in the previous step.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create an Access Token">
    After the request_token has been approved, exchange the request token for an access token.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    https://api.themoviedb.org/4/auth/access_token \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token' \
    -d '{
        "request_token": "your_request_token"
    }'
    ```

*You'll receive a response containing an access token and account ID:*

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "account_id": "12345678"
}
```

<Tip>
  Store this access token securely. Unlike the request token, this access token does not expire unless revoked by the user from their TMDB account settings.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Using the Access Token">
    Finally, use the access token in the Authorization header to make authenticated API requests.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
    https://api.themoviedb.org/4/account/12345678 \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token'
    ```

<Note>
  Replace `12345678` with the actual account ID you received in the previous step.
</Note>

You can now access user-specific endpoints and perform actions on behalf of the user.
